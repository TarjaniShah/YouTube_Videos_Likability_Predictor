This is a Data Science project, using machine learning concepts to predict the likeability of a given YouTube video. As more and more companies turning to YouTube influencers to capture the millennial audience, getting people to watch your videos on YouTube is becoming increasingly lucrative. 

Goal: To create a model that can help influencers predict the likeability for their next video.

Following is the high-level approach:
Data Collection and Pre-processing
	•	Topic: Food
	•	Extracted data from Google Developer Console’s YouTube Data API functions.
	•	Collected all the necessary variable influencing the likeability of a video
	•	Feature engineered dependent variables
Exploratory Data Analysis
	•	EDA on different channel types, days.
	•	Commonly used words in a word cloud to search the video.
Modeling:
	•	Linear Regression
	•	GradientBoostingRegressor
	•	XGBRegressor
	•	Random Forest Regressor
